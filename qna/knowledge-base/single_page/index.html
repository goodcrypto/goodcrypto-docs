                        <p>

                        Your GoodCrypto private server has its own web site. This is not on GoodCrypto, but on the computer where you installed GoodCrypto.

<p>
Ask your administrator for the correct URL for your GoodCrypto server website.
</p>

<p>
Use your browser to connect to your server's website. We recommend that you use a secure connection (i.e., https). The https key for your site is dynamically generated to be unique just for you. The first time you access your new site, you'll need to approve its self signed key. When your browser says it can't verify the site, <strong>that is normal</strong>. It's a private site so no public certificate authority knows about it.

<p>
<strong>Secure access:</strong> Prefix the IP address for your GoodCrypto server with <strong>https:</strong> and add <strong>:8443</strong> after the IP address.
Don't forget the colon (:) between the IP address and the port number.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Insecure access:</strong> Prefix the IP address for your GoodCrypto server with <strong>http:</strong> and add <strong>:8080</strong> after the IP address. Don't forget the colon (:) between the IP address and the port number.
</p>

<p>
For example, if your private server's IP address is: 192.168.10.200, then the url for your server would be:
</p>

<ul>
https://192.168.10.200:8443 (example only)<br/>
http://192.168.10.200:8080 (example only)
</ul>

You must <a href="/qna/technical/user-credentials-to-sign-in.html">sign in</a> for some actions (e.g., verify a message arrived privately).

                        <p>

                        GoodCrypto is distributed as a preconfigured, bootable ISO. It contains all the software that you need to protect your group's mail and browsing, including full source. You simply need to integrate it with your mail server and browsers.

<p>
As years of experience with TLS, SSH, and GPG have shown, configuring crypto is hard. GoodCrypto is preconfigured to remove the hassles and improve security.

<p>The smaller your group is, the less you can afford to install and configure your own crypto. The larger your organization is, the less you can afford users to install and configure their own crypto.

        <li> <strong>Back up any data from the hard drive.</strong> GoodCrypto will reformat the drive to reduce the possibility of hidden malware.</li>
        <li> <strong>Boot the new computer from the iso.</strong> GoodCrypto needs a dedicated data drive. If it can't find an empty one to format, it will say so and not boot. You might see an error message about the wrong file type which you can ignore. GoodCrypto will automatically format the drive with the correct type. On the first boot, you may notice a delay. GoodCrypto is reformatting the empty drive and creating unique keys.
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Configure and maintain your GoodCrypto server on your private website.</strong> Browse to the new computer's IP address using port 8443 if you're using https, or 8080 if you're using http. Examples: http://199.18.0.50:8080 or https://199.18.0.50:8443. We recommend you use https, but remember that your private server has a self-signed cert so you'll need to have your browser accept the cert. <em> If your browser says it can't contact the site, wait a few minutes and try again.</em> </li>
        <li> <strong>Enter the administrator's address for the domain you want to protect on your GoodCrypto private server.</strong>

<p>
If you have multiple servers, you may prefer to
<a href="/qna/knowledge-base/postfix-config-script/index.html"> run a script </a>
on each mail server. You can automate this alternative.
</p>

<p>
To make sure you don't lose any mail while you test the new configuration, GoodCrypto configures postfix to "soft bounce" messages. This means that if there are issues after you change your configuration, your mail server will tell the sender's mail server to try again after a few hours. Once you're happy that the configuration is working as expected, you can remove the soft bounce configuration line.

                        Exim4 support is experimental.

<ol>
  <li>Edit <strong>/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf</strong> so the <strong>dc_local_interfaces</strong> line includes <strong>; GC_PRIVATE_SERVER_IP.10028</strong> before the closing quote mark. Change GC_PRIVATE_SERVER_IP to the IP address of your GoodCrypto private server.<p>&nbsp;</p></li>

                        <p>

                        GoodCrypto's filter should be the first filter for inbound mail and the last filter for outbound mail.
<p>
If you want other content filters to run (e.g., an antivirus filter), then we recommend you either follow Wietse Venema's (the author of postfix) advise <a href="http://postfix.1071664.n5.nabble.com/Postfix-Multi-Instance-on-multiple-hosts-td50073.html">configure a separate instance of postfix for each filter</a> or use a third party product like Amavisd-new.

                            GoodCrypto comes with a preconfigured firewall. Your own firewall needs to allow access to the server.

                        <p>

                        You'll need to open the following ports for the GoodCrypto machine:

<table>
<tr>
<th width="20%">Port</th>
<th width="20%">Interface</th>
<th width="20%">Direction</th>
<th width="20%">Purpose</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9151</td>
<td>tcp</td>
<td>in</td>
<td>tor</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8398</td>
<td>tcp</td>
<td>in</td>
<td>web proxy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8080</td>

<td>out</td>
<td>milter port</td>
</tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11371</td>
<td>tcp</td>
<td>in</td>
<td>hkp port (used by keyservers)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The directions in and out are from the viewpoint of your GoodCrypto Server.
</p>

<p>Also, if you run GoodCrypto in a VM, we recommend a firewall on the computer that runs the VM with the same ports open. These ports assume the hypervisor is <strong>not</strong> running as root.

                        <p>

                        Your GoodCrypto private server reduces the vectors of attack by limiting the software installed on the server to the bare minimum. For example, the server does not include ssh and includes a firewall to restrict access.

<p>
Your primary concern should be securing the computer running GoodCrypto and keeping up-to-date with security releases.

<p>
The most secure way to operate GoodCrypto is on a headless machine. Regardless where you've installed your server it should be behind a well secured network firewall and with limited physical access.
</p>

<p>
Keeping all security software current is essential so you're not exposed to vulnerabilities.
<p>

<p>
Other suggestions...
<ul>
<li>You should not add any other software to your server</li>
<li>If you're running GoodCrypto in a VM, then don't have any other software running on the computer.</li>
<li>Change the <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/change-mail-options/index.html">Mail | Options</a> on <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/access-goodcrypto-server.html">your GoodCrypto server's</a>  so users must <a href="/qna/technical/user-credentials-to-sign-in.html">sign in</a> to verify fingerprints and export keys.  This will reduce unauthorized users from figuring out your group's contacts.</a>
</ul>

You might also want to require a new key be verified before it can be used by changing the <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/change-mail-options.html">Mail | Options</a> on <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/access-goodcrypto-server.html">your GoodCrypto server's</a>. A disadvantage might be that it's more hassle for users before they can communicate privately.

                        <p>

                        Your backup procedure depends on where you've installed your GoodCrypto private server.

<h5>Stand alone computer</h5>

It's best to back up the entire drive where you installed GoodCrypto. This will make restoration quick and easy.

If you are limited in space and you have physical access, then you can just backup /media/drive/persistence.

<h5>Virtual machine</h5>

You simply need to back up the the VDI file that you created when you set up the virtual machine.

                        It would be easy for someone else to fake a message so it appears that the message arrived privately when it didn't. Only the recipient of the message can verify that it was received privately.

<p>
If your administrator entered the URL for your GoodCrypto private server in the <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/change-mail-options.html">GoodCrypto private server options</a>, then a URL is included at the bottom of the message which lets you confirm the message was received privately by your GoodCrypto private server. You must <a href="/qna/technical/user-credentials-to-sign-in.html">sign in</a> with the email address of the recipient of the message to verify the status.

<p>
If you only see the unique validation code, then connect to your <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/access-goodcrypto-server.html">Goodcrypto Server website</a>, sign in with the credentials for the user that received the message, click the
<strong>Mail</strong> menu and then the <strong>Verify</strong> button next to <strong>Private messages</strong>, and enter the validation code.
<p>
If you do not know the validation code, then click the <strong>Received</strong> button next to <strong>Private messages</strong>. You'll see a list of all messages that you received securely. The list shows the sender's email address, date, message id, and validation code.

                        <br/>



                        <p>

                        The most common way is when your contact appears to have successfully read a message you encrypted to them, but you need at least one more verification to be safe.

<p>
Ask the contact to provide their public key or its <a href="/qna/technical/fingerprint.html">fingerprint</a> through a channel other than email. The key or fingerprint must match your own copy.  Compare fingerprints as described below.

<p>
Best is face to face.
Other examples are for them to publish their key's fingerprint on a public
site or service, or provide it by phone, SMS (if encrypted), or snail mail.

<p>
If you are verifying by hand, the longest version of the fingerprint is best.
You don't have to verify the whole key by hand.
A fingerprint is a really good summary of a key.
If you verify the key's fingerprint, you have verified the key.

<p>
If you got a public key from a web site,
it doesn't help much to verify using a fingerprint from the same web site.
An attacker can spoof the web site and provide a matching fake fingerprint.

<h4>To compare a fingerprint using GoodCrypto:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Browse to <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/access-goodcrypto-server.html">your GoodCrypto server website</a>.</li>
  <li>Click on the <strong>Verify fingerprint</strong>; if the button is not on the screen, then click the <strong>Mail</strong> menu</li>
  <li>Type in the email address and click the <strong>Verify</strong> button.</li>
  <li>
        A fingerprint and a key summary are the same thing.
        Compare the <strong>Key summary</strong> with the other person's <strong>Key summary</strong>.
        Ignore spaces and whether a character is upper or lower case.
        Otherwise they must match.
  </li>
  <li>
        <font color="red"><strong>
            If they don't match, do NOT use that key to communicate.
        </strong></font>
  </li>
  <li>If the fingerprint is not flagged as verified and you have verified it, then you should <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/mark-key-verified.html">flag the fingerprint as verified in the database</a></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
If the other person is also using GoodCrypto Mail, then they should follow this same procedure. Otherwise, they must use their encryption software program to get the key summary, known as the fingerprint in most encryption software, for the matching email address.

                        You have two options: <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/import-from-file/index.html">import a key from a file</a> or <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/import-from-keyserver.html">import it from a keyserver</a>. It's probably most reliable to ask your contact to export their key into a file and send it to you.

<p>
If your contact has stored their key on a public keyserver, then you can import the key from the keyserver. You can use their email address to find their key, but it's more reliable if you use their fingerprint. If your GoodCrypto private server can't find the key on the keyserver, then ask which keyserver the key is on. Then ask your mail administrator to add that server to your private server.

<p>
GoodCrypto will automatically create a private key, if one doesn't exist, whenever a user sends email to anyone.
</p>

<p>
Key generation can take a minute or more so after the first message is sent, the user probably wants to wait a few minutes before sending another.
</p>

<p>
If you elect to turn off automatic key generation in the <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/configure-mail-options">Options</a>. If you elect to do this, then you'll need to <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/gen-key-manually.html">generate the keys manually</a>.

                        Your GoodCrypto private server adds a record in the database every time someone sends or receives private email. Each record shows the type of encryption the contact uses and their fingerprint.

<p>
Also, the administrator can flag each contact so email must always be encrypted or never be encrypted. This allows you to maintain the appropriate level of security on a person by person basis.
</p>

<p>
If there's a contact that you know you never want to send encrypted email, then you might want to add that contact and select the "Never encrypt" option.

<strong>Mail server address:</strong> The ip address for your mail server (i.e., the server running postfix or exim for your mail).
</p>

<p>
<strong>GoodCrypto server url:</strong> The full url, including port, to access your GoodCrypto server.
</p>

<!--p>
<strong>Exchange public keys P2P:</strong> When enabled, GoodCrypto automatically:
<ul>
<li>adds the sender's key(s) to every outbound message</li>
<li>imports keys received in the header and alerts the recipient to verify the new key</li>
<li>verifies the key in the header matches the key already in GoodCrypto's database</li>
</ul>

<p>
Automatic key exchange eliminates one of the major headaches of using crypto. When you're communicating
with compatible software, then there's no need to import contacts' keys nor send yours.
</p>

<p>
We strongly recommend that you have a check mark in this field.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Create keys:</strong> If enabled, then GoodCrypto automatically creates a
key for every user in your domain. The first time a user with your domain sends or receives a
message, GoodCrypto generates a public and private key. Email is sent letting them know
when the key is ready.
</p>

<p>If you already have private keys for some or all of your users, then you can export both the public and private key into one file, and <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/import-private-key.html">import</a> it.

<strong>Metadata and Traffic Analysis Protection</strong>

<div style="text-indent:25px">
<p>
<strong>Encrypt metadata:</strong> When enabled, GoodCrypto protects all the
metadata, except the date, the domain address for each group, and basic email header
details (like originating server) when it sends messages to recipients with compatible software
<a href="/server/docs/metadata.html">Learn more</a> about how metadata protection works.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Padding and packetization:</strong> If enabled, then GoodCrypto holds messages for each domain
it has a special "metadata key". On a regular schedule it combines the individual messages going to
a domain, pads them to a standard size to create a single message, encrypts the message
that protects all the messages and hides all individual metadata, and sends it.
</p>

<p>
If there are no messages that need to be sent to a domain, then a message is still sent at the
regular schedule.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/server/docs/metadata.html#TrafficAnalysis">Learn more</a> about traffic analysis protection.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Packet size:</strong> The minimum size of the message containing one or more messages.
If the total of pending outgoing individual messages are too big for a single standard group message,
unsent messages are queued for later. If a message is bigger than the group message size it is
returned to the sender with an explanation.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Frequency:</strong> The schedule packetized messages will be sent.

<a name="TighterSecurityMailOptions"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></a>
<strong>Tighter security</strong>

<div style="text-indent:25px">
<p>
<strong>Require outbound encryption:</strong> If enabled, then GoodCrypto requires all outbound mail be encrypted. This means that if someone sends a message and there is no key for the recipient, then the message will bounce to the sender.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Require verify new key:</strong> If enabled, then GoodCrypto requires that you
must log into
<a href="/qna/knowledge-base/access-goodcrypto-server/.html">your GoodCrypto private server</a>
after you verify a new key and add a check mark that they
key has been verified. If someone tries to send a message to a contact with an unverified key, then
the sender's message is returned to them with details about how to proceed.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Require login to view fingerprint:</strong> When enabled, GoodCrypto
requires that you login to your GoodCrypto private server to view a fingerprint, also known as a key id.
Your <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/access-goodcrypto-server.html">GoodCrypto private server</a> should be behind your firewall configured so only your own people can reach it. But if you do not require login, it is possible that an unauthorized person could learn which individuals communicate securely.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Require login to export keys:</strong>If enabled, then you must login to
<a href="/qna/knowledge-base/access-goodcrypto-server.html">your GoodCrypto private server</a>
to export a fingerprint, also known as a key id.
Your <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/access-goodcrypto-server.html">GoodCrypto private server</a> should be behind your firewall configured so only your own people can reach it. But if you do not require login, it is possible that an unauthorized person could learn which individuals communicate securely.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Filter HTML:</strong> When enabled, GoodCrypto removes known malware vectors from
encrypted, inbound email. This is not</strong> a replacement for spam and virus filters.
</p>
<p>
We strongly recommend that you run anti-spam and anti-virus software after
GoodCrypto runs so unencrypted messages can be checked and filtered.
</p>
</div>

<a name="SignaturesMailOptions"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></a>
<strong>Signatures </strong>

<div style="text-indent:25px">
<p>
<strong>Clear sign mail:</strong> If enabled, then GoodCrypto adds a GPG signature after an outbound message
is encrypted. If you're not protecting your metadata, then clear signing
makes it easier to track your messages.</p>
<p>
All encrypted messages are also signed as part of the encryption
if the sender's key exists at the time of encryption. When signing is done as part of the
encryption, instead of clear signed, then the recipient will know the message
was encrypted by the sender, but not someone who intercepts the message will not be able to
determine the sender's signature.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Add DKIM signature:</strong> When enabled, GoodCrypto adds a DKIM signature to each outbound message.
Many large companies rely on DKIM signatures to identify whether a message originated from the sender.
We'd also advise that you add SPF support to your DNS configuration to add further credibility to
your messages.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Verify DKIM signatures:</strong> If enabled, then GoodCrypto verifies the first DKIM signature of
each signed message. If the message passes verification, then a tag is added to the bottom of the
message and the signature is removed from the header so other filters don't inacurrately report
the signature was bad.
</p>

<p>
<strong>DKIM delivery policy:</strong> If an inbound message contains a DKIM signature and you enabled
<strong>verify DKIM signatures</strong>, but the key does not verify for any reason, then you
can decide whether to <strong>drop</strong> the message or delivery it with a warning.
</p>
<p>
If the message is dropped, then it is not delivered and the sender is not informed about the error.
The reason that GoodCrypto does not report the error to the user is because some spammers use
bounced messages as a way to abuse mailing systems.
</p>

<a name="DkimPublicKey"></a>
<p>
<strong>DKIM public key:</strong> The public key for your domain used by DKIM. You must include this
key in a TXT record for your domain. The selector is <strong>mail</strong>, the hash code is
<strong>rsa-sha256</strong>, the key type is <strong>rsa></strong>, and the key length is 2048 bits.
</p>
</div>

<a name="OtherMailOptions"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></a>
<strong>Other</strong>

<div style="text-indent:25px">
<p>
<strong>Use keyservers:</strong> If enabled, then GoodCrypto will check the <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/manage-keyservers.html">active keyservers</a> to find keys for contacts without keys. If a key is found, then the first user who tried to send a message to that contact receives email alerting them about the new key.
</p>

<p>
This option does not impact whether someone can import a key <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/import-from-keyserver.html">from a keyserver</a>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Enable diagnostic logs:</strong> If enabled, then GoodCrypto logs the encryption
and decryption process.
</p>

<p>
We strongly recommend that you only enable this option if you're having trouble with GoodCrypto or
processing messages. Logs may contain sensitive data.

The administrator has a lot of flexibility about when encryption is used. Of course, the recipient or the recipient's company must also being using encryption for any messages to be encrypted.
</p>

<p>
You can require all outbound message be encrypted by going to the Mail | Options and adding a check mark to the appropriate field. Of course, it's not likely that everyone you exchange messages will also be using encryption so you can add each email address to the Mail | Contact list and select <strong>Never</strong> to the <strong>Encrypt to contact</strong> field.
</p>

<p>
You can also decide that there are particular individuals that you only want to exchange encrypted message. Again, add a Contact and select strong>Always</strong> to the <strong>Encrypt to contact</strong> field.
</p>

<p>
Here's a chart showing how the global option <strong>Require outbound encryption</strong>, and a Contact's <strong>Encrypt to contact</strong> fields impact which messages are sent as plain text, which are encrypted, and which will bounce to the sender.
</p>

<p>
Of course, if the recipient's system is also using GoodCrypto and you are protecting metadata, then all messages to the recipient's system will be encrypted regardless of the other global or contact's settings.

                        <p>

                        You should remove the IP address before the port in your /etc/postfix/master.cf. For example, if the line now reads:

<pre>
12.167.295.8:10026 inet  n       -       n       -       10      smtpd
</pre>

Change the line to look like this:
<pre>
:10026 inet  n       -       n       -       10      smtpd
</pre>

If you are running multiple instances of postfix, then you should also consider adding the following line to the main.cf for the postfix configuration that is reporting the error:

<pre>
smtp_bind_address = 0.0.0.0
</pre>

                    </p>

                        If you receive this message, you should look very carefully at the attachment. It's possible that someone has included a key for another user in the header. GoodCrypto will only import a key if the sender matches the key.

If you participate in a mailing list, then you might see this message because some mailing list servers forward messages with the original headers. You can simply ignore it.

We would love you to forward the message to us after you replace any personal email addresses and IP addresses with XXX.
<p>
If you look at the bottom of the message you may find some details that you can act upon. For example, if the GoodCrypto private server runs out of memory, the message will include, "Cannot allocate memory". You'll need to add memory to the server.

                        <p>

                        It takes a while to generate and exchange keys.

<p>
Your messages from someone aren't encrypted until they have your key. They get a message from you with a line added by GoodCrypto saying "You received a new public key." After that, messages from them to you will be encrypted. Not before.

This appears to be a false alarm that happens when your GoodCrypto Private Server is rebooted.

<p>
If the error shows again after you restart your browser, reboot your own system.

<p>
If you see the same error again right after you reboot, it's probably real. Follow the instructions on the screen.

<p>
Sometimes this error is temporary. It disappears when you restart your browser or reboot. Or it may be a real attack.

Firefox has had this intermittent error since version 31.0.
The simplest solution is to use an earlier version of Firefox.
