                    Email with people who still don't have
privacy software works as it always has. Messages you send them will not be private and so they -- and anyone who intercepts your messages -- can read them just like they did before you
installed GoodCrypto.

<p>
People with no protection at all will
get a note at the bottom of your messages reminding them of
the risks of unprotected email. You'll get a note at the bottom of their messages letting you know it wasn't private. That way you always know which messages arrived at your mail server privately, and which didn't. You can also verify which messages <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/verify-message-arrived-privately.html">arrived</a> and <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/confirm-message-was-sent-privately.html">were sent</a> privately.</p>

<p>
If a contact is using another PGP product, then you will have to <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/export-public-key.html">export your key</a> and send it to them so they can send your private messages. And, they will need to send you their key and you <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/import-from-file.html">import it</a> or <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/import-from-keyserver.html">import it from a keyserver</a> so you can send private email to them. Don't forget to <a href="/qna/knowledge-base/user-verify-key.html">verify their fingerprint</a> before you rely that you're exchanging private messages.
