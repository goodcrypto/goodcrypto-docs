Documentation for GoodCrypto Private Server

The 'qna' and 'server' subdirectories should be added to your
GoodCrypto private server's /var/local/projects/goodcrypto/server/src/templates
directory. You will then be able to read the files as they are
filtered through your server's website.

You can also find the docs on https://goodcrypto-private-server.sourceforge.io
